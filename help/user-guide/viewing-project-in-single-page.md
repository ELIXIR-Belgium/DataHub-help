# Single page view

A Project can be visualised in Single Page by selecting the button “Single Page” at the top right corner of a roject page.
In Single Page, Experiments (Investigation, Study, Assay), Samples and the linked SOPs in a Project are shown in a tree view on the left side of the page, while each item’s details are shown and accessible from the center of the page. As more items are added, the tree will expand.
