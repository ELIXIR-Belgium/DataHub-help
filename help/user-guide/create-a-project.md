# What is a Project

A Project represents a group of one or more people collaborating together on a particular activity. The Project provides the ability to describe and promote the activity, and also give credit back to the team. The Project will have a title, and optionally a description, public website and avatar graphic. Users need to be a member of a Project before they can register items, which will then be related to that Project and a user can be in many Projects without limit.

As well as providing credit, a Project also has useful abilities such as default Sharing permissions and licence, and the ability to easily set sharing permissions across all members of the Project. Some members of the Project may have special Gatekeeper and Housekeeper roles within the Project - for more information see [Specialist user roles](./roles.html).

The Project will have its own [Project Administrator](./roles.html#project-administrator.html) - usually the user that initially requested the project. As well as editing the Project details, this user can also add and remove members, and set their roles and define additional administrators. They may also define new Institutions, Profiles (to describe members that have not yet registered) and Organisms.

A member of the Project will also be related to an Institution for the context of that Project (some users may be related to different Institutions for different Projects).

# What is a Programme

If configured to be enabled, FAIRDOM-SEEK may also have Programmes. Programmes are an umbrella that contains one or more Projects. They are a self-administered area, that describes a broad activity (usually related to a funded grant), such as a consortium, or a long running activity that will need additional Projects. 

Once approved, The Programme will have a [Programme Administrator](./roles.html#programme-administrator) who is free to immediately create additional Projects without requiring additional approval. 

The Programme must have a title, and can optionally also have a description, funding details, website, and avatar graphic.

For users that just require a single Project, and don't require a Programme, a site managed Programme can be defined (recommended) to which their Project will be associated. They will then just administer their Project without needing to worry about Programmes. Their Project can be moved to their own Programme in the future if necessary.
