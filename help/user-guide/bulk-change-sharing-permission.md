you can see all the items you own in two lists: 
* Items are grouped to those included and those not included in the ISA (Investigation-Study-Assay) structure;
* The item list excludes **Project**, **Institution** and **Publication** since these are always publicly visible;
* You can view current permissions of each item by clicking the item's name;
* Select items you want to change their sharing permissions by checking the checkbox;
* If no items are selected before clicking the “next” button, the error message “Please choose at least one item!” will pop up.
