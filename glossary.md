  * Reset: (from info icon)resets the graph to its original state, reverting any changes to zoom or moved nodes.
* Split: (from user guide)The Split view provides a combination of the Tree and Graph view, with the tree shown on the right. 
* Tree: (from info icon)display with a folder like tree view. (from user guide)The tree view is the default view, and shows the ISA structure as folders, similar to a file browser.

### Study
From user guide: A study is a particular biological hypothesis or analysis.
From info icon: A Study is a particular hypothesis, which you are planning to test, using various techniques. A Study must belong to one Investigation and it can contain one or more Assays.
