## Version 1.13.3

Release date: _16th May 2023_

A small patch release that contains bug fixes and small improvements:

* Ability to recursively select items in the tree when batch changing permissions
  * ( for 1.14 this will be further improved and combined with batch publishing which is a very similar action)
* When running with Docker, a new PUMA_WORKERS_NUM environment variable can be used to control the number of puma
  workers, overriding the default that is set to the number of available processor cores
* Fix for when combing filtering with ordering by views or downloads
* Fix for publications incorrectly showing a license that cannot be set

## Version 1.13.2

Release date: _14th April 2023_

A small patch release that contains several bug fixes and small improvements, including

* Ability to tag Investigations and Studies, providing better overall consistency
* Fix duplicate projects appearing in Workflow RO-Crates
* Sort items by view or download counts in the filtered search index views
* A new Sample attribute type, _Controlled Vocabulary List_, that supports multiple terms selected from a Controlled Vocabulary as an array
* Fix to correctly provide the content length in HTTP headers for downloads that was missing in some cases, and also added the Content-MD5 header to include the md5 checksum
* Programmes are now listed in MyItems, and related items generally, if the user is the Programme Administrator but not directly a member of a related Project
* Space out daily background jobs so that they don't all run at once, avoiding potential memory issues

* Fix to an error when interacting with the Ontology Lookup Service API, which affected creating and using sample types and controlled vocabularies in some cases.
* More tolerant URL checking when registering a remote asset. 
* Removed option to generate a DOI for a hidden version.

For a full list, see [closed issues for 1.12.1](https://github.com/seek4science/seek/milestone/9?closed=1)

## Version 1.12.0

Release date: _6th May 2022_


For a full list, see [closed issues for 1.12.0](https://github.com/seek4science/seek/milestone/6?closed=1)

This version includes:

* **Collections** - the ability to bundle together items that are conceptually related into an ordered list, which can
  then be shared together as collection.
* **New customisable front landing page** - a cleaner front page, with more useful information, that can be customized
  and configured per SEEK instance.
* **Sample attributes enhancements** - attributes can be provided a description, which provides more details when
  entering or viewing a sample. They can also be given a persistent identifier, to provide a semantic definition of the
  attributes meaning.
* **Improvements to how creators can be credited** - there is now an improved UI for crediting the creators, or authors,
  of assets. Extra information, such their as ORCID and affiliation, can now be added for each creator, even if they are
  not registered in SEEK. The exact order of how creators appear can also be specified.
* **Explicit ordering of Investigations, Studies and Assays** - each can be provided with an explicit order within the
  other, rather than the order they are added. They can re-ordered at any time.
* **Ability to link a Sample to multiple other samples** - previously, a sample could only be linked to a single other
  sample. This has now been updated to allow a one to many relationship as long as the samples are of the same type.
* **EDAM annotations for workflows** - describe the workflow operations and topics from the EDAM ontology. This is also
  planned to be reused to describe data types and formats.
* **Simpler branding settings** - for SEEK administrators, the settings to give particular branding to an instance were
  complicated and confusing. This has now been simplified, and organised in logical groups.
* **Moved related items into a tab** - the list of related items associated with the item shown have now been moved into a separate tab, rather than needing to
  scroll to the bottom of the page. There are also plans to move other information, such as versions and files, into
  additional tabs.
* **Fixes and improvements running to under a relative URL** - for those running SEEK under a relative URL (
  e.g. https://mysite.com/fairdom-seek/), some issues were found with incorrect links. These problems have now been
  fixed, for both Docker and Bare-metal installations, and the testing process improved.
* **Batch registration of Samples through the API** - it is now possible to register Samples in batches through the API,
  rather than one by one, to reduce the number of necessary calls and performance.
* **Updated to use latest version of Apache Solr** - the Apache Solr that was being bundled with SEEK, was no longer
  being maintained and updated. This locked SEEK to an older version of Java. Solr has now been separated, that can be
  installed separately using the latest version, along with an updated configurations. A new updated Docker image is
  also now available.
* **Workflow API enhancements** updates to support the GA4GH TRS API, allowing one click execution of Galaxy workflows, and support for registering an RO-Crate through the API.
* **Extending the items a workflow can be linked to** - ability to link a workflow to Datafiles (as test, example and training data),
  Documents, SOPs, and Presentations as well as Publications.
* **User defined workflow types** - users can now add to the selection of workflow types, if they can't find the one
  they need, when registering a workflow.

## Version 1.11.2

Release date: _6th October 2021_

A small update release with minor changes and bug fixes, in particular:

* Finalised Sample and Sample Type read/write API, along with completed documentation.
* Bioschemas improvements with greater compliance, and the addition of _conformsTo_ clause to indicate which version is
currently being used.
* Recommended licenses, which appear at the top of the list. The FAIRDOM-SEEK admin has the ability to set and change these under Settings.
  The license ID is now also validated that it is recognised when set through the API.
* Fix to a critical issue with Sample and Custom metadata attributes of type Boolean, which prevented them being set through the UI.
  This also includes a fix to allows an empty value if the attribute is optional.
* Allow project join requests to be approved where the optional Institution Country is missing.
* Show the date a user joined on their profile page, visible to all logged in registered users.

For a full list, see [closed issues for 1.11.2](https://github.com/seek4science/seek/milestone/7?closed=1)

## Version 1.11.1

Release date: _19th July 2021_

A small update release with a few small changes and bug fixes, in particular:

  * Fix to a rarely encountered bug that caused a user to be added to a project with a nil Institution, which could then lead to other problems
  * Fix to remove some warning messages about a duplicate definition of _include_blank_
  * Person responsible for Study has been deprecated and removed from the user interface 

For a full list, see  [closed issues for 1.11.1](https://github.com/seek4science/seek/milestone/5?closed=1)

## Version 1.11.0

Release date: _21st June 2021_

This version includes:

  * **Changes to joining a project during registration**. 
    * During registration a user will no longer be asked to select a Project and Institution, (this was often missed). Instead, they will be prompted to either Join or Create a Project after registration and until they are a member. 
    * [Joining a Project](/help/user-guide/join-a-project.html) now has an easier interface to search and select the projects the users want to join, and to define either a new Institution or select an existing one
    * The Project administrator is notified by email, and is provided with a single page to accept the join request more easily, and is also prompted through the FAIRDOM-SEEK interface if there are outstanding requests.
  * **Simplified Project and Programme creation.** 
    * A user can now more easily request to [create a Project](/help/user-guide/create-a-project.html). The Project creation request can include a Programme if enabled, along with defining a new Institution or selecting an existing one. 
    * If a Programme or site administrator is needed to approve the request, there is a simpler interface to accept or reject quickly, and the administrators are prompted through the FAIRDOM-SEEK interface as well as email.
  * **Site managed Programme.** 
    * FAIRDOM-SEEK can now configured to include a site managed Programme.
    * This can be selected by users who do not want to a Programme to self administer and add additional Projects.
  * **Markdown formatting of descriptions.** 
    * Support has been added for [markdown elements in descriptions](/help/user-guide/general-attributes#description).
    * It includes an editor with shortcuts for common formatting options, together with a preview option.
  * **Ontology based controlled vocabularies.** 
    * FAIRDOM-SEEK now supports Sample attributes limited to controlled vocabularies (CVs) backed by an ontology.
    * This extends the current capability for a controlled vocabulary to be specified by a list of strings.
    * The ontology backed CV's can be easily populated in the User Interface via the Ontology Lookup Service. They may also be populated manually with Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRI's).
  * **Spreadsheet view for exploring Comma and Tab separated value files (CSV or TSV).** 
    * FAIRDOM-SEEK adds support for exploring CSV/TSV files uploaded as a DataFile.
    * The exploration presents a table view of data.
    * The exploration extends the existing Excel file explore feature.
  * **Condensed view of lists.** 
    * When viewing the standard index page for items, FAIRDOM-SEEK now has an alternative  [condensed view](/help/user-guide/browsing.html) that can be selected.
    * The condensed view has collapsible items, that make it easier to view and browse more results in a single results page.
  * **Table view of lists.** 
    * When viewing the standard index page for items, there is now an alternative view that can displays [items in a table](/help/user-guide/browsing.html).
    * By default, a small set of columns of data about the items are shown. This set can be extended and customised to include attributes related to that item type.
  * **MIAPPE support with custom metadata extensions.** 
    * FAIRDOM-SEEK now adds the ability to extend entities with additional metadata attributes. The focus is currently on extending metadata for Investigations, Studies and Assays to support [MIAPPE](https://github.com/MIAPPE/MIAPPE).
    * The ability is generic and can be used to define custom metadata extensions for any item type; this allows FAIRDOM-SEEK to support different standards.
    * Future versions plan to provide 
      * a UI to allow the  definition of new extensions,
      * pre-defined definitions for repository standards, and also
      * support for MIAPPE observed variables.
  * **Bulk changing of sharing permissions.** 
    * FAIRDOM-SEEK 1.11 adds the ability to [bulk change the sharing permissions](/help/user-guide/bulk-change-sharing-permission.html) of many items in a single step.    
  * **Simplified deleting of Projects.** 
    * FAIRDOM-SEEK now allows the deletion of Projects by the Project administrator, even if the project still has members.
    * The members will automatically be removed
    * Projects that contain assets or Investigations, Studies or Assays cannot be deleted without first removing them.
  * **Run with Copasi button.** 
    * Added ability to download a publicly downloadable model to a local installed Copasi application and to start the simulation in Copasi 
  * **Changing visibility of item versions.** 
    * Historically past versions of an item have been visible to registered users, but not to those logged out (anonymous).
    * FAIRDOM-SEEK now supports all past versions being visible (in accordance with the sharing permissions of the item),
    * The visibility of specific versions can be controlled by the user - completely hiding individual versions if wished.
    * Existing versions continue to follow the original permissions until explicitly changed.

    * Additional metadata attributes including _booktitle_, _editor_, _publisher_, _a remote URL_
    * For publications, which are manually registered or imported from bibtex files, users can edit all fields of publications.
    * For publications registered with DOI, users can refresh the metadata by clicking "edit publication"
    * Improvements to importing publications by a bibtex file
      * Ability to import different types of publications
      * Add more validations to support different types of publications
      * Generate the citation according to the type of publications when there is no DOI or Pubmed ID

    * If you wish to provide the ability to open a discussion about an item, one or more links can be added to locations
    such as Slack, GitHub issue, a Forum thread
  * A "Request Contact" button for Assets, to allow a registered user to initiate an email discussion with the owner and creators of that item.
  * Increased zoom level when previewing model images, and ability to view the original in its full resolution
  * Support for 'include' when using the JSON API
    * Allows you to get full details about related resources in a single call ( see [JSONAPI specification](https://jsonapi.org/format/#fetching-includes))
    * For example <https://fairdomhub.org/projects/19.json?include=people> expands information about the people in an _included[]_ block at the end of the top level JSON. 
  * Study Experimentalists attribute has been deprecated - existing entries aren't lost and can be edited, but the attribute has been removed
  for new entries or existing entries where that attribute hasn't been set 
  * Renaming of _contributor_ to _submitter_ - to be clearer about what this attribute represents
  * Update of [BiVeS](https://semsproject.github.io/BiVeS/) - used for model version comparisons, has been updated to the latest available version  
    
  
There have also been many other minor bug fixes and improvements.  

_Note_ that with this version, we moved from JIRA to [Github Issues](https://github.com/seek4science/seek/issues), and
for this and probably future versions have stopped providing links to individual tasks.

  * Project Dashboard help link

A full list of changes included in this release can be found in the [SEEK v1.8.1 release notes](release-notes-1.8.1.html)

## Version 1.8.0

Release data: _February 12th 2019_

  * **openBIS integration** has been extended and improved upon, mainly through contributions from [Tomasz Zielinski](https://fairdomhub.org/people/711) 
  of [SynthSys](https://fairdomhub.org/programmes/21). The extensions include linking between Studies and openBIS Experiments, and Assays and openBIS Objects.
  Automation has also been added to automatically detect and synchronise new items. For more information please read our [Guide for using openBIS with SEEK](/help/user-guide/openbis.html).
  **Note** that to use the new features, [openBIS 18.06.1 or later](https://wiki-bsse.ethz.ch/display/bis/openBIS+Download+Page) is required. 
  * A new **Project Dashboard** has been added, to allow project members to view various statistics and trends, including graphs, within their project. 
  For more information please read the [Project Dashboard Guide](/help/user-guide/project-dashboard.html) 
  * **Former project members**, that have been marked as inactive within a project, are now more clearly indicated along with the date they left.
  * **Project start and end dates** can now be defined for a project, which, if defined, are displayed on the Project page.
        
A full list of changes included in this release can be found in the [SEEK v1.8.0 release notes](release-notes-1.8.0.html)   

## Version 1.7.1

Release date: _November 19th 2018_

  * Fix to a bug where the session table column was too small. This sometimes led to a datafile upload problem if the user was in a large number of projects.
  * Show the Project creation date on its _show_ page. (In 1.8 we plan to include the option to specify the project start and end dates).
  * Fix to a bug where some assets couldn't be edited if shared across multiple projects, and the user only belonged to a subset of those projects.
     
A full list of changes included in this release can be found in the [SEEK v1.7.1 release notes](release-notes-1.7.1.html)     

## Version 1.7.0

Release date: _October 15th 2018_

  * **Programme wide sharing permissions** have been added.  The sharing options now include the ability to share across a whole Programme.
  * **ISA graph improvements** - we spent some time revisiting the ISA graph, fixing some underlying issues and making it more usable. It now defaults to showing the tree view, and 
  the graphical view is simplified and highlights the current item and its nearest neighbours. It no longer includes the associated Project and Programmes to avoid unnecessary interlinking 
  and complexity. The intention is that the graph view should provide a quick visual indication of the place of the current item within the ISA network, and provide the ability to explore and navigate 
  over the graph. A separate export function has been provided to all easy generation and download of PNG files for inclusion in reports or presentations. 
  * A dedicated **NCBI ID sample attribute type** has been added, which accepts a number and displays as an identifier URI. If the NCBI id matches an Organism present in SEEK then the link will automatically be made.   
  * Restrictions to **Sample Type visibility** have been added. Sample types are now initially only visible to members of the Project they are associated with, until it starts having Samples associated with it. 
  The Sample Type will become visible outside of the project, and to external users, once one or more samples associated with that Sample type have been made public. This allows more freedom to allow all project members to create
  Sample Types, without the difficulties of having full sharing permissions on Sample types, whilst restricting the Sample Types exposed outside of the Project. 
  * The ability to link **Documents to Events**, and vice versa, has been added.

A full list of changes included in this release can be found in the [SEEK v1.7.0 release notes](release-notes-1.7.0.html)

## Version 1.6.3

Release date: _August 21st 2018_

  * Fix to prevent users flagged as having left a project being able to access items shared with that project 
  (they can still access their own items, or items also shared within them in other ways)
  * Fix to an error occuring when a large number of Documents are associated with an Assay
  * Fix to manually adding an organism manually through its NCBI ID, when the ID URL is provided with surrounding spaces.


A full list of changes included in this release can be found in the [SEEK v1.6.3 release notes](release-notes-1.6.3.html).

## Version 1.6.2

Release date: _July 5th 2018_

  * Fixed a bug when viewing a Project page that has more that 5 visible Documents associated with it.
  * Avoid warning about missing projects when uploading a standard Excel file, being mistaken as RightField template.
  * When running SEEK through Docker, write the Puma output and error logs to files.
  
A full list of changes included in this release can be found in the [SEEK v1.6.2 release notes](release-notes-1.6.2.html).  

## Version 1.6.1

Release date: _June 20th 2018_

Bugfixes and some small improvements, in particular

  * Fixed an error when uploading a DataFile with no Assays in the database (only seemed to affect Docker)
  * Fixed a mime type problem when uploading files, in particular CSV files being incorrectly treated as Excel
  * When using the DataFile upload wizard, the arrow keys no longer affect navigation whilst editing a field

## Version 1.6.0

Release date: _June 8th 2018_

Major changes include:

  * Interlinking the [**ELIXIR Norwegian e-Infrastructure for Life Sciences (NeLS)**](https://nels.bioinfo.no/) with the SEEK platform. 
 This will provide NeLS and SEEK users with unprecedented opportunities for storing, sharing, 
 and archiving of data in ways that comply with the FAIR principles.
  * Our second installment of our [**JSON API**](/help/user-guide/api.html), in particular to include support for **writing** and submitting new entries in SEEK. 
    Most write abilities are now available through the API including creating Datafiles, SOPs, Models, 
    Investigation, Studies and Assays and linking them together. More details about the api can be found in the 
    [API Guide](/help/user-guide/api.html), with more technical details found in the [JSON API Overview](/tech/api/index.html) 
  * Changes to the  **DataFiles upload workflow**, along with better RightField template support. The flow has been changed such that the 
 file is registered before providing additional details. This allows information to be extracted and details automatically populated where
 possible. The supported templates are now provided as part of the templates generated for Sample Types, but will soon be available more widely.
  * DataFile metadata is now provided through a [**Wizard**](/help/user-guide/data-file-upload-wizard.html), split into logical steps, that can easily be stepped through.
  * Assays can be created and linked to the DataFile being submitted as part of the same process. This can either be manual or from the details provided within
 a template.
  * Support for a new **Document** asset type. This is to represent general documents that do not fit as other asset types - such as
  reports or meeting minutes.     
  * Ability to enable and provide **Terms and Conditions**, that need to be accepted as part of the registration process
  * Creating **DOI's** for individual items has been made clearer and easier to use.    

There have also been many other bug fixes and small improvements.
A full list of changes included in this release can be found in the [SEEK v1.6.0 release notes](release-notes-1.6.0.html).
 
 
## Version 1.5.2

Release date: _February 20th 2018_

A full list of changes included in this release can be found in the [SEEK v1.5.2 release notes](release-notes-1.5.2.html).

  * An error that prevented a Programme submission being rejected
  
A full list of changes included in this release can be found in the [SEEK v1.5.1 release notes](release-notes-1.5.1.html).
  

## Version 1.5.0

Release date: _December 11th 2017_

This is quite a large release, and the main highlights include:

  * Our first released version of our **JSON API**. This has been built to conform to the [JSON API](http://jsonapi.org) specification, 
    and is documented on [SwaggerHub](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/FAIRDOM/SEEK/0.1).
    This read API has been developed in conjuction with, and feeds into, a write API which will be released incrementally
    in subsequent releases. For more details please read [API](/help/user-guide/api.html).
  * Incorporating the new **[JERM 2 ontology](http://jermontology.org)**, along with updates and extensions to the RDF produced by 
    SEEK.
  * **Migrated legacy sharing permissions**: Given registration for SEEK is open to anyone, 
  we have removed the ability to administer sharing permissions of items for _“all registered users”_. 
  This ability was removed from the user interface several versions ago, but a number of items retained this legacy sharing permission. 
  Items shared with “all registered users” have now been updated so that their sharing permission is “project wide” instead, according to the projects the item is associated with. 
  This restricts the audience which can interact with the item. 
  Owners and managers of items are still free to continue to choose and change the sharing permissions as they wish.
  * If users wish to **request to join a project**, but do not know the user that administers it, there is now a button available to do so. A message
  will be sent the administrators of those projects with additional details. When added to a project, the new member is automatically notified
  by email. A request can only be sent once every 12 hours.
  * **DOI's and ORCiD** identifiers, where used or created, are now displayed more clearly in various views and lists.

## Version 1.2.0

Release date: _January 23rd 2017_

Large update with many new features and improvements, in particular a new approach to handling Sample information.

  * A major reimplementation and design of our support for Samples
    * Developed as part of our discussions within the [FAIRDOM-ELIXIR Samples Club](http://fair-dom.org/communities/samplesclub/), which was setup specifically to overcome problems with
     our old BioSamples
    * Flexible system that allows users to design their own Sample Type standards, which are associated with an 
    extractable spreadsheet template
      * Templates can be autogenerated, or Sample Types created from existing templates.
      * Sample Types contain a user designed set of attributes, and attribute types. 
      Validation is included to check a value matches its type, or if specified as ‘required’ a presence check is carried out.
      * Units can be optionally associated with a Sample Type attribute.
      * Sample Types can be interlinked, for example a Tissue Sample Type may link to a Patient Sample Type
      * Samples can be added to SEEK according to sample type. They can either be added manually, or many can be 
      extracted from an uploaded data file that originated from the associated template.
      * An attribute can be linked to a controlled vocabulary which enforces a set of values. 
      This also puts in place future support for CV’s from standard ontologies.
    * Assays were updated to now represent the first of many future processes, which can receive and produce sets of samples. 
    UI improvements were made to support easily associating many samples to an assay in at once. 
    A Process describes the changes a Sample may go through.
    * This new framework now has possibility to support the SampleTab standard, allowing SEEK to deposit to the EBI Biosamples registry    
    * A more flexible approach to handling Samples was an important requirement for full openBIS integration.
    * It is a framework that can be built upon and enhanced according to user needs in future versions.
    * There is documentation available in our [SEEK Samples User Guide](/help/user-guide/samples.html)
  * An improved Graphical and interactive ISA graph viewer. It now contains all details but expands as the user interacts 
  with it, avoiding the problem of over-complex graphs. A tree view is also now available to navigate the graph, 
  which includes the Programmes and Projects. A full view of the graph is available if necessary.
  * Authorization speedup. A significant improvement in speed and scale when updating the permissions of an item, 
  or a person changing state (e.g. to a  new role or project). For performance reasons authorization is cached, which 
  needs updating when a state changes. This resulted in a noticeable delay observed between users when permissions are changed 
  (as a background task updates the cache), sometimes causing confusion. This delay has now been significantly reduced, 
  and the delay is not dependent on the number of items.
  * Support for [Docker](https://docker.com), along with documentation. Docker images are automatically built for
   different versions and can be run either as a single container or multiple micro-services split across different containers. 
  Handles upgrades and persistent data. Docker allows SEEK to be setup and run with a single command. This our expected 
  approach to simple packaging of SEEK with openBIS.
    * Documentation on using SEEK with Docker is available in our [Docker Guide](/tech/docker.html)
  * A Project administrator may now specify the default license for their project which is automatically selected when creating a new item, but can be changed by the user if necessary.
  * Improved usability of adding new Publications from a DOI or PubmedID
  * Arbitrary URL schemes for remote files, that can be handled outside of SEEK. For example, and scp:// url could be 
  provided for and openSSH based resource
  * Storage metrics in one place available to SEEK administrator, split by Project and Programme. 
  Provides a single place to monitor storage rather than checking each Project page.
