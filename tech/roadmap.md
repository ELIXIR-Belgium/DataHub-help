# Roadmap

This is an outline of plans the core SEEK development team will be working on in the near future.

It is an overview of the main priorities, and milestones. SEEK is developed following an Agile development process, meaning some of the features and timing may change - however, these items are very high in our priorities. 

They are expected to be added to SEEK in roughly the order they are presented here.

| Feature | Milestone date |
| --- | --- |
| Generic Custom Metadata fields | 2020  |
| Extended Studies with extended metadata, supporting MIAPPE | 2020 |
| Ontology based metadata attributes, including for samples | 2020 |

<br/>

Please also see the [Workflow Hub Roadmap](https://about.workflowhub.eu/roadmap/), 
which is being built upon and in conjuction with FAIRDOM SEEK.
