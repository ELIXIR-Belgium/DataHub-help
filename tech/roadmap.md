# Roadmap

This is an outline of plans the core FAIRDOM-SEEK development team will be working on in the near future.

It is an overview of the main priorities, and milestones. FAIRDOM-SEEK is developed following an Agile development process, meaning some of the features and timing may change - however, these items are very high in our priorities. 

They are expected to be added to FAIRDOM-SEEK in roughly the order they are presented here.

| Extended integration with the Norwegian e-Infrastructure for Life Sciences (NeLS) system | Q2 2023        |
| Enhancements to Sample support | Q2 2023        |
| UI for creating Custom Metadata Extensions | Q3 2023        |
| Additional Search configuration improvements, with UI improvements for Search filtering | Q3 2023        |
| API support for creating new versions | 2023           |
| Project folders, to help organise files outside of the ISA structure | 2023           |
| ISA improvements, with a single page for creating and managing them | 2023           |
| Deposition to repositories, such as ENA | 2023           |
