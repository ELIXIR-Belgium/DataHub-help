# Roadmap

This is an outline of plans the core FAIRDOM-SEEK development team will be working on in the near future.

It is an overview of the main priorities, and milestones. FAIRDOM-SEEK is developed following an Agile development process, meaning some of the features and timing may change - however, these items are very high in our priorities. 

They are expected to be added to FAIRDOM-SEEK in roughly the order they are presented here.

| Feature | Milestone date |

| Search configuration improvements, with UI improvements for Search filtering | Q3 2022 |
| Project folders, to help organise files outside of the ISA structure | Q3 2022 |
| UI for creating Custom Metadata Extensions | Q3 2022 |
| Describing Observed Variables within MIAPPE | Q3 2022 |
| Enhancements to Sample support | Q4 2022 |
| Backend storage changes with better versioning support | Q4 2022 |
| Better support for GitHub | Q4 2022 |
| Support for Datasets containing multiple files organised into folders | Q4 2022 |
| API support for creating new versions | Q4 2022 |
