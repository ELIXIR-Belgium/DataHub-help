# Roadmap

This is an outline of plans the core FAIRDOM-SEEK development team will be working on in the near future.

It is an overview of the main priorities, and milestones. FAIRDOM-SEEK is developed following an Agile development process, meaning some of the features and timing may change - however, these items are very high in our priorities. 

They are expected to be added to FAIRDOM-SEEK in roughly the order they are presented here.

| Feature | Milestone date |
| --- | --- |
| Collections - grouping assets together under a topic or theme | Autumn 2021 |
| A new customizable front page | Autumn 2021 |
| Improvements to defining authors and creators, and their order | Autumn 2021 |
| Explicit ordering of items within ISA | Autumn 2021 |
| Better and easier definition of institutions, integrating the Research Organization Registry (ROR) | Winter 2022 |
| License improvements, using SPDX | Winter 2022 |
| Project folders, to help organise files outside of the ISA structure | Winter 2022 |
| UI for creating Custom Metadata Extensions | Winter 2022 |
| Describing Observed Variables within MIAPPE | Winter 2022 |
| Backend storage changes with better versioning support | Winter 2022 |
| Better support for GitHub | Winter 2022 |
| Support for Datasets containing multiple files organised into folders | Winter 2022 |
