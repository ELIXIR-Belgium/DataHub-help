# Roadmap

This is an outline of plans the core FAIRDOM-SEEK development team will be working on in the near future.

It is an overview of the main priorities, and milestones. FAIRDOM-SEEK is developed following an Agile development process, meaning some of the features and timing may change - however, these items are very high in our priorities. 

They are expected to be added to FAIRDOM-SEEK in roughly the order they are presented here.

| Feature | Milestone date |
| --- | --- |
| Collections - grouping assets together under a topic or theme | Summer 2021 |
| Sample and Sample Type API | Summer 2021 |
| Project folders, to help organise files outside of the ISA structure | Summer 2021 |
| UI for creating Custom Metadata Extensions | Summer 2021 |
| Backend storage changes with better versioning support | Autumn 2021 |
| Better support for GitHub | Autumn 2021 |
| Support for Datasets containing multiple files organised into folders | Autumn 2021 |
| API support for creating new versions | Autumn 2021 |

Please also see the [Workflow Hub Roadmap](https://about.workflowhub.eu/roadmap/), 
which is being built upon and in conjuction with FAIRDOM-SEEK.
